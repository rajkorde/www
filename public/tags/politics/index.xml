&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ratio&#34;&gt;Twitter Ratio&lt;/a&gt; is an unofficial measure of how unpopular a particular tweet is. It is calculated simply by dividing the number of replies to the tweet by the number of favorites (or retweets). The logic being if its a crappy tweet, you would get fewer favorites and more replies. Thus higher the ratio, worse the tweet. In this post, I look at Trump’s twitter ratio since the day of his inauguration and his most unpopular tweets (as in tweets with highest twitter ratio).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;America has gotten more and more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/&#34;&gt;politically polarized&lt;/a&gt; over the years. This polarization is reflected in several states voting consistently red or blue in the presidential elections year after year. This analysis investigates several red-blue stereotypes popular in the media and measures how well they align with the actual voting patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump&#39;s emotional graph this year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, David Robinson published an &lt;a href=&#34;http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/&#34;&gt;excellent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Trump’s tweets. Given below is a relatively straightforward extension of his work where I plot various emotions in Trump’s tweets over time. Each line is smoothed to remove noise. The y-axis is proportion of a given sentiment in all tweets sent per week. The sentiments were calculated using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm&#34;&gt;NRC word-emotion lexicon&lt;/a&gt;. The tweets considered here are limited to ones sent from Android because David’s analysis showed that Trump most likely only tweets from his Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
