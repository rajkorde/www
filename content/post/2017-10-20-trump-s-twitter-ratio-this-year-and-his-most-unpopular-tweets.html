<p><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ratio">Twitter Ratio</a> is an unofficial measure of how unpopular a particular tweet is. It is calculated simply by dividing the number of replies to the tweet by the number of favorites (or retweets). The logic being if its a crappy tweet, you would get fewer favorites and more replies. Thus higher the ratio, worse the tweet. In this post, I look at Trump’s twitter ratio since the day of his inauguration and his most unpopular tweets (as in tweets with highest twitter ratio).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I calculate twitter ratio as replies divided by favorites and not retweets, because I have found many people ironically retweet Trump’s tweets. But I doubt anyone favorites his tweets ironically. Given below is his twitter ratio calculated weekly. The trend line shows that his twitter ratio has been gradually increasing at a slow rate. However, this may be because his twitter ratio was abnormally low in the first couple of weeks of his presidency. What I found more striking is the wild variations in the ratio (changes by almost 2x). I think its reflective of the chaotic nature of his presidency where a storm is always brewing anytime there is some quiet.</p>
